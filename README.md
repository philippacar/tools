# PHP script for tracking the cryptocurrency rate and sending notifications when it changes:

This script regularly polls the cryptocurrency API to get the current rate, compares it to the previous value, and sends a notification to the specified email address if there is a change. To use, you must specify an API key, a cryptocurrency symbol, an email address for notifications, as well as specify the interval between requests and the conditions for determining rate changes. The script continues its work in an endless loop, regularly updating course data.
